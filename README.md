# OctoPrint-Parametric-Macros
Setting up and using parametric macros using OctoPrint and various plugins.
  Along with other hints and tricks.

## Select and install the plugins
Run, don't walk, to https://plugins.octoprint.org/
and get:<br>
<li>
  GCode Macros https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPrint-GcodeMacros<br>
  OctoPrint Gcode Macros Plugin
    Create custom commands you can add anywhere: in your gcode file, OctoPrint’s terminal, gcode scripts, or other plugins to run a configured script.<br>
    Use macros for preheating your printer, levelling the bed, changing filament… Possibilities are (nearly) endless!<br><br>
</li>
<li>
  GCode Systems Commands https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-GCodeSystemCommands<br>
    This OctoPrint plugin adds the ability to define GCode commands that execute local system commands.<br><br>
    </li><br>

## You can also use this plugin(maybe)
<li>
  Custom Control Editor https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/customControl/<br>
    Makes custom controls editable via the settings dialog.<br>
    This plugin helps you create, edit and delete your custom controls. You can easily access all the options in the settings under “Custom Control Editor”.<br>

# The Magic
Ok, first, I walked away from using Microsoft products in 2004 or so and have never looked back (except to laugh!)<br>
If you want to do this on Windows (without loading up some Linux compatability programs) you are in your own...<br>
That being said - Welcome!<br>
### Note 1:
To save yourself some heartache, place ALL your bash shell scripts in "/home/$USER/.octoprint/scripts/"
### Why:
The directory is backed up and restored with OctoPrint Backup command! I even put my boot and crontab files there.<br><br>
